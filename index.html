<h3>RetroCraft is my free fan-made edition of Minecraft beta 1.7.3.<br>
This version has improved textures and launching is now much easier!<p>
RetroCraft already has Java built in, so you don't need to install it.<br>
Before playing, make sure your computer has at least 2GB of RAM,<br>
as having less than that can cause your system to crash.</h3><p>
